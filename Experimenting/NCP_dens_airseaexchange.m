%% get time window averaged variables for ASE

O2_ase.Salt = [means_struct.S_surf]; % practical
O2_ase.Temp = [means_struct.T_surf]; %degC
O2_ase.press = [means_struct.sea_level_pressure_atm];
O2_ase.wind10sq = [means_struct.wind_squared]; % mean(wind^2)
O2_ase.wind10 = [means_struct.wind]; % wind normal
% This is already wind speed at 10m, added
% 10% on during data processing - see mistrals.sedoo website

%% oxygen saturation
% Benson and Krause (1984) - equation 24 using tables 5 and 9 and
% atmospheric pressure (atm) from Meteo buoy
% O2 sat taking into account pressure
O2_ase.O2_saturation = o2satSTP(O2_ase.Temp, O2_ase.Salt, O2_ase.press*1013.25);
% convert to mmol m^-3
O2_ase.O2_saturation = ([means_struct.sig0_surf]/1000) .* O2_ase.O2_saturation;

%% Schmidt number
% % The Schmidt number is the kinematic viscosity of water divided by the
% % molecular diffusion coefficient of the gas, should = 568 at 20C in 35
% % salinity water
% % The kinematic viscosity for fresh water and seawater are from Sharqawy et al. (2010). 
% % The diffusion coefficients of gases are from the following: Ar, O2, N2, N2O, and CCl4 fit
% % using Wilke and Chang (1955) as adapted by Hayduk and Laudie (1974).
O2_ase.ScO2 = 1920.4 - (135.6 * O2_ase.Temp) + (5.2122 * O2_ase.Temp.^2) ...
    - (0.10939 * O2_ase.Temp.^3) + (0.0009377 * O2_ase.Temp.^4); 

%% Gas diffusivity
O2_ase.KO2 = 0.251 .* O2_ase.wind10.^2 .* ((O2_ase.ScO2/660).^-0.5); % gas diffusivity

%% Calculate airsea exchange
% gas diffusivity, bubble, and schmidt also calculated in funciton 'ASEflux'
[O2_ase.ASE O2_ase.ASE_uncertainty] = ASEflux(O2_ase.Temp, O2_ase.wind10, O2_ase.wind10sq, ...
    [means_struct.O2_surf],[means_struct.O2_surf_std],O2_ase.O2_saturation,O2_ase.press,1,1);
